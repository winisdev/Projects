 v20.3.2.
It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using classical cryptography methods like Additive Cipher and Autokey Cipher.

PS. This is just a school activity.

Features:

Additive Cipher (Caesar Cipher) — Encrypt and decrypt text using character shifting.
Autokey Cipher — A stronger cipher that uses the plaintext as part of the key.
Vigenère Cipher — A polyalphabetic substitution cipher for more secure encryption.
Real-time encryption and decryption.
Simple, clean UI for easy interaction.
