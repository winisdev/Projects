CryptoApp

CryptoApp is a simple web application built with Angular CLI v20.3.2.

It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using classical cryptography methods such as:

Additive (Caesar) Cipher

Autokey Cipher

Vigenère Cipher

Note: This project was created as a school activity.

Features:

Additive Cipher (Caesar) 

  — Encrypt and decrypt text using character shifting.

Autokey Cipher

  — A stronger cipher that uses the plaintext as part of the key.

Vigenère Cipher 

  — A polyalphabetic substitution cipher for more secure encryption.

Real-time encryption and decryption.

Simple, clean UI for easy interaction.
